# Shotgun Schema Introspection Toolkit App

![sb-shotgun-schema-introspection.png](./screenshots/sb-shotgun-schema-introspection.png)

##### This is a simple Toolkit app that allows Shotgun and Toolkit developers to quickly navigate and inspect the Shotgun entities, fields and the underlying schema.
##### I've had this in my toolbox for years and thought it might be useful to others.
***
##### Step 1 - Select the Entity your are interested in inspecting
##### Step 2 - Select the Field your are interested in inspecting
##### Step 3 - View the underlying schema of the field
##### Step 4 - If there is a schema change hit refresh to get the latest
##### Step 5 - By default, all "Connection" entities will be filtered from the results. Uncheck to display them

***
##### Feel free to reach out to me with any questions or ideas.
